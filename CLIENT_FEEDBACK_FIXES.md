# Client Feedback Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of client feedback issues identified and fixed in the laundry management system.

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Owner Portal - SKU Selection (COMPLETED)
**Issue:** Owner portal was showing ALL SKUs when creating orders, not just SKUs with custom pricing for the selected customer.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/OwnerDashboard.js` (Line ~1175)
- **Change:** Removed fallback logic that showed all SKUs
  - BEFORE: `{(customerSkus.length > 0 ? customerSkus : skus).map(...`
  - AFTER: `{customerSkus.map(...`
- **Added:** Clear placeholder message: "No custom pricing set for this customer"
- **Impact:** Prevents confusion and ensures orders can only be created with properly priced SKUs

---

### ✅ 2. GST Labeling - "Ex GST" Display (COMPLETED)
**Issue:** Australian legal requirement to show "Ex GST" labels on all pricing displays.

**Fixes Applied:**

#### Owner Dashboard
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/OwnerDashboard.js` (Line ~1175)
- **Change:** Added "(Ex GST)" label to SKU prices in dropdown
  - Format: `{sku.name} - ${price.toFixed(2)} (Ex GST)`

#### Customer Dashboard - SKU Selection
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.js` (Line ~453)
- **Change:** Added "Ex GST" label to SKU prices
  - Format: `{sku.name} (${sku.customer_price.toFixed(2)} Ex GST)`

#### Customer Dashboard - Order Display
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.js` (Line ~650-665)
- **Change:** Added complete GST breakdown showing:
  - Subtotal (Ex GST): `${(total_amount / 1.1).toFixed(2)}`
  - GST (10%): `${(total_amount - (total_amount / 1.1)).toFixed(2)}`
  - Total (Inc GST): `${total_amount.toFixed(2)}`

#### Customer Dashboard - Delivery Tracking
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.js` (Line ~920)
- **Change:** Updated label from "Total Amount" to "Total Amount (Inc GST)"

**Impact:** Full compliance with Australian GST display requirements

---

### ✅ 3. Recurring Orders - Next Occurrence Date Calculation (COMPLETED)
**Issue:** Recurring orders were calculating the next occurrence from the order creation date instead of the delivery date, causing incorrect scheduling.

**Example Problem:**
- Order created: 22/10/2025
- Delivery date: 17/11/2025
- Next occurrence was showing from 22/10/2025 instead of 17/11/2025

**Fixes Applied:**

#### Owner Order Creation
- **File:** `backend/server.py` (Line ~811-835)
- **Change:** 
  - BEFORE: `current_date = datetime.now(timezone.utc).date()` as base
  - AFTER: `delivery_date = datetime.fromisoformat(order.delivery_date).date()` as base
- **Calculation:** Next occurrence now adds frequency to delivery_date

#### Customer Order Creation
- **File:** `backend/server.py` (Line ~900-920)
- **Change:** Same fix applied to customer order creation endpoint
  - Changed base from `current_date` to `delivery_date`
  - Ensures consistency across all order creation paths

#### Order Update Endpoint
- **File:** `backend/server.py` (Line ~1003-1040)
- **Change:** Added logic to recalculate next_occurrence_date when:
  - Order is recurring (`is_recurring = true`)
  - Recurrence pattern is provided
  - Delivery date is updated
- **Impact:** Ensures next occurrence stays accurate even when orders are modified

**Impact:** Correct recurring order scheduling based on actual service delivery dates

---

### ✅ 4. Customer Frequency Template Editing (COMPLETED)
**Issue:** Customers could not change the frequency template (scheduled delivery units) when editing existing orders.

**Root Cause:** The recurring order toggle and frequency template selector were hidden when editing orders:
```javascript
{!editingOrderId && ( // This prevented editing
  <Switch checked={orderForm.is_recurring} ...
```

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.js` (Line ~506-540)
- **Changes:**
  1. Removed `{!editingOrderId &&` condition - now always visible
  2. Added `disabled` prop that respects order lock status:
     - `disabled={editingOrderId && !canModifyOrder(...)}`
     - Prevents changes after 8-hour lock period
  3. Applied same disable logic to frequency template selector
  
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.js` (Line ~159-190)
- **Changes:** Updated `handleUpdateOrder` to include recurring fields:
  - Added `is_recurring` to form data
  - Added `frequency_template_id` and `recurrence_pattern` when recurring
  - Ensures backend receives complete recurring order data

**Impact:** 
- Customers can now modify recurring settings on existing orders
- Changes respect the 8-hour lock period for data integrity
- Full support for converting regular orders to recurring and vice versa

---

## Issues Remaining to Fix

### ❌ 5. Admin Password View/Edit Capability (TODO)
**Issue:** Admin needs ability to view/edit customer passwords for account lockout scenarios.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add password reset functionality to admin dashboard
- Security consideration: Use password reset (generate new) rather than viewing existing
- **Files to modify:**
  - `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.js` - Add UI for password management
  - `backend/server.py` - Create new endpoint for admin password reset

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Admin support capability

---

### ❌ 6. Customer Order Placement Error Investigation (TODO)
**Issue:** Customer getting "Contact admin to setup pricing" message despite having pricing configured.

**Analysis:**
- Backend endpoint `/skus-with-pricing/{customer_id}` looks correct
- Sets `has_custom_pricing` flag based on customer_pricing records
- Frontend filters to only show SKUs where `has_custom_pricing === true`

**Need to investigate:**
1. Are customer_pricing records being created properly in OwnerDashboard?
2. Is customer_id being passed correctly?
3. Are there any validation errors preventing pricing from saving?

**Files to check:**
- `frontend/src/pages/OwnerDashboard.js` - Customer pricing creation
- `backend/server.py` - `/customer-pricing` POST endpoint
- Verify database records in customer_pricing collection

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks customer orders and revenue

## Technical Details

### GST Calculation Formula
```javascript
// Given total_amount (includes GST):
subtotal_ex_gst = total_amount / 1.1
gst_amount = total_amount - subtotal_ex_gst
// OR: gst_amount = subtotal_ex_gst * 0.10

// Verification:
// subtotal_ex_gst + gst_amount === total_amount
```

### Recurring Date Calculation
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get delivery date as base
delivery_date = datetime.fromisoformat(order.delivery_date).date()

# Calculate next occurrence based on frequency type
if frequency_type == 'daily':
    next_date = delivery_date + timedelta(days=frequency_value)
elif frequency_type == 'weekly':
    next_date = delivery_date + timedelta(weeks=frequency_value)
elif frequency_type == 'monthly':
    next_date = delivery_date + timedelta(days=30 * frequency_value)

order_dict['next_occurrence_date'] = next_date.isoformat()
```

### Order Lock Logic
- Orders locked after 8 hours from creation
- Lock prevents: item changes, address changes, frequency changes
- Lock enforced in both frontend (UI disabled) and backend (validation)
- Function: `canModifyOrder(created_at)` checks if still within 8-hour window

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Owner SKU Selection
- [ ] Create order for customer with NO custom pricing → Should show clear message
- [ ] Create order for customer WITH custom pricing → Should show only priced SKUs
- [ ] Verify SKU prices display with "(Ex GST)" label

### 2. GST Display
- [ ] Create order and verify GST breakdown in customer dashboard
- [ ] Check all three values: Ex GST + GST (10%) = Inc GST
- [ ] Verify math: subtotal / 1.1 + (subtotal - subtotal/1.1) = total

### 3. Recurring Orders
- [ ] Create recurring order with future delivery date
- [ ] Verify next_occurrence_date = delivery_date + frequency
- [ ] Update recurring order delivery date → Verify next_occurrence recalculates

### 4. Frequency Template Editing
- [ ] Create regular order → Edit to make recurring → Save successfully
- [ ] Create recurring order → Edit → Change frequency template → Save
- [ ] Try editing order after 8 hours → Verify controls are disabled
- [ ] Edit order within 8 hours → Verify can change recurring settings

### 5. Integration Testing
- [ ] Full order lifecycle: Create (recurring) → Edit (change frequency) → Track delivery
- [ ] Verify all pricing displays show "Ex GST" consistently
- [ ] Test with multiple customers with different pricing setups
