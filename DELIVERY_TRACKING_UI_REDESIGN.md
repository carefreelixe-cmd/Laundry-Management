```

#### New Filter Functions

2. **Filters Card**: Collapsible filter controls with clear button
3. **Order Cards**: Full-width cards with:
   - Left status bar (2px wide)
   - Main content area with flex layout
   - Left column: Order details, addresses
   - Right column: Timeline progress

### Responsive Design

## Filter Functionality

### Date Range Filter
- Filter by delivery date (from/to)
- Inclusive date range checking
- Handles end-of-day for "to" date

### Status Filter
- Multi-select capability
- Toggle individual statuses on/off
- Visual indication (teal=active, gray=inactive)
- Filters: assigned, picked_up, out_for_delivery, delivered

### Clear Filters
- Button appears only when filters are active

## Timeline Visualization

Each order card includes a compact timeline showing:
1. **Assigned**: Clock icon, timestamp
2. **Picked Up**: Package icon, timestamp
3. **Out for Delivery**: Truck icon, status
4. **Delivered**: Check circle icon, timestamp

Icons are color-coded:
- Active stages: Colored backgrounds with white icons
- Pending stages: Gray backgrounds with gray icons

## Technical Details

### Performance
- Filters use Array.filter() for efficient client-side filtering
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Memoization of filtered results

### Maintainability
