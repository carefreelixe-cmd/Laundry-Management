## ✅ Issue #5: Admin Password Management

### What Was Built
- **New "User Management" Tab** in Admin Dashboard
- Password reset capability for all users
- Secure implementation using password hashing
- Email notifications for password changes

### Key Features
1. **User List Display:**
   - All users with role-based color badges
   - User details: name, email, phone, ID, creation date
   - Clean, organized card layout

2. **Password Reset Dialog:**
   - Secure password input field
   - Minimum 6 character validation
   - Confirmation warning before reset
   - Loading states during operation

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Passwords are never displayed (only reset)
   - New passwords are hashed before storage
   - User receives email notification
   - Requires admin/owner authorization

### Technical Implementation

**Frontend (AdminDashboard.js):**
```javascript
// New state variables
const [resettingPasswordUserId, setResettingPasswordUserId] = useState(null);
const [showPasswordDialog, setShowPasswordDialog] = useState(false);
const [selectedUser, setSelectedUser] = useState(null);
const [newPassword, setNewPassword] = useState('');

// Password reset handler
const handlePasswordReset = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!newPassword || newPassword.length < 6) {
    toast.error('Password must be at least 6 characters long');
    return;
  }
  
  setResettingPasswordUserId(selectedUser.id);
  try {
    await axios.put(`${API}/admin/reset-password/${selectedUser.id}`, {
      new_password: newPassword
    });
    toast.success('Password reset successfully');
    setShowPasswordDialog(false);
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error(error.response?.data?.detail || 'Failed to reset password');
  } finally {
    setResettingPasswordUserId(null);
  }
};
```

**Backend (server.py):**
```python
@api_router.put("/admin/reset-password/{user_id}")
async def admin_reset_password(user_id: str, password_data: dict, 
                               current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["owner", "admin"]))):
    """Admin endpoint to reset user password"""
    new_password = password_data.get('new_password')
    
    # Validate password
    if not new_password or len(new_password) < 6:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, 
                          detail="Password must be at least 6 characters long")
    
    # Hash and update password
    hashed_password = hash_password(new_password)
    await db.users.update_one(
        {"id": user_id},
        {"$set": {"password": hashed_password}}
    )
    
    # Notify user
    await send_notification(
        user_id=user['id'],
        email=user['email'],
        title="Password Reset",
        message=f"Your password has been reset by an administrator.",
        notif_type="password_reset"
    )
    
    return {"message": "Password reset successfully"}
```

### Files Modified
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.js` - Added User Management tab
- ✅ `backend/server.py` - Added password reset endpoint

## ✅ Issue #6: Customer Pricing UX Improvement

### Problem Analysis
The system was working correctly - when customers saw "No items available", they genuinely didn't have custom pricing set up. However, the UX provided no explanation, causing confusion.

### Solution
Added a prominent warning banner that appears when customers have no custom pricing configured.

### Visual Design
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  No Pricing Configured                           │
│                                                      │
│ You don't have any custom pricing set up yet.      │
│ Please contact your administrator to configure      │
│ pricing for your account before placing orders.    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Technical Implementation

**CustomerDashboard.js:**
```javascript
// Import AlertTriangle icon
import { Package, AlertCircle, Plus, MapPin, Calendar, Lock, 
         Unlock, Repeat, Edit, Truck, Clock, CheckCircle, 
         AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-react';

// Add warning banner (appears when skus.length === 0)
{skus.length === 0 && (
  <Card className="border-yellow-300 bg-yellow-50">
    <CardContent className="p-4">
      <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
        <AlertTriangle className="w-5 h-5 text-yellow-600 mt-0.5" />
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-yellow-900">
            No Pricing Configured
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-yellow-800 mt-1">
            You don't have any custom pricing set up yet. 
            Please contact your administrator to configure pricing 
            for your account before placing orders.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
)}
```

### How The System Works
1. **Owner Sets Pricing:** 
   - Owner dashboard → Customer Pricing tab
   - Select customer → Select SKU → Set custom price
   - Backend creates record in `customer_pricing` collection

2. **Backend Marks SKUs:**
   - `/skus-with-pricing/{customer_id}` endpoint runs
   - Fetches all SKUs and customer_pricing records
   - Sets `has_custom_pricing = true` for SKUs with pricing
   - Returns all SKUs with flag

3. **Frontend Filters:**
   - Customer dashboard fetches SKUs
   - Filters: `skus.filter(sku => sku.has_custom_pricing)`
   - Only shows SKUs where customer has custom pricing

4. **Warning Display:**
   - If `skus.length === 0` → Show warning banner
   - Customer sees clear explanation
   - Call-to-action: "Contact administrator"

### Files Modified
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.js` - Added warning banner
