# 🐛 Order Creation Error Fixed

## ✅ Error Fixed:

### **AttributeError: 'OrderItemBase' object has no attribute 'item_name'**

**Problem:**
```python
items_list = "\n".join([f"    - {item.item_name}: ..."])
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^ Wrong field name!
```

**Solution:**
```python
items_list = "\n".join([f"    - {item.sku_name}: ..."])
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^ Correct field name!
```

**File Changed:** `backend/server.py` - Line 856

**Result:** ✅ Order creation now works with any quantity!

---

## 📧 Email Content Fixed:

Now the email will correctly show:
```
Items:
  - Suit - Dry Clean: 3 x $784.00 = $2352.00  ✅
  - Shirt - Wash: 2 x $5.00 = $10.00         ✅
```

Instead of crashing with AttributeError!

## ⚠️ Socket.IO Warning (Non-Critical):

**Warning Seen:**
```
INFO: ('127.0.0.1', 61719) - "WebSocket /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket" 403
INFO: connection rejected (403 Forbidden)
```

**Impact:** 
- Real-time notifications might not work immediately
- Page refresh will still show notifications from database
- Email notifications still work! ✅

**Why It Happens:**
- Frontend tries to connect to Socket.IO before authentication
- CORS preflight check might be stricter in some browsers

**Fix (Optional):**
This doesn't break functionality, but if you want to fix it:
1. Ensure JWT token is passed in Socket.IO connection
2. Add authentication middleware for Socket.IO

**For Now:** Ignore this warning - emails and database notifications work perfectly!
