# Driver Assignment Fix

## Issue
Owner could assign the same order to a driver multiple times, causing confusion and data inconsistency.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (`OwnerDashboard.js`)

#### Visual Indicator for Assigned Orders
- **Before**: Assignment dropdown and button always visible
- **After**: Shows "✓ Already Assigned" badge when order has a driver

#### New UI States:
```jsx
// Order NOT assigned - Show assignment controls
<Select> Choose Driver </Select>
<Button> Assign </Button>

// Order ASSIGNED - Show status badge + unassign option
<Badge> ✓ Already Assigned </Badge>
<Button> [X] Unassign </Button>
```

#### New Function: `handleUnassignDriver()`
- Confirms action with user
- Calls unassign API endpoint
- Refreshes order list
- Shows success/error toast

#### Icon Import
- Added `X` icon from lucide-react for unassign button

### 2. Backend Changes (`server.py`)

#### Enhanced Assign Driver Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/orders/{order_id}/assign-driver`

**New Validation**:
```python
# Check if order already has a driver assigned
if order.get('driver_id'):
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=400, 
        detail=f"Order is already assigned to driver: {order.get('driver_name', 'Unknown')}"
    )
```

**Result**: API-level protection prevents duplicate assignments

#### New Unassign Driver Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/orders/{order_id}/unassign-driver`

**Functionality**:
- Removes driver assignment from order
- Resets delivery_status to "pending"
- Clears assigned_at timestamp
- Sends notifications to:
  - Unassigned driver
  - Customer

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Driver unassigned successfully",
  "old_driver": "John Doe"
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: First Assignment
1. Owner selects driver from dropdown
2. Clicks "Assign" button
3. Order gets assigned
4. UI updates to show "✓ Already Assigned"
5. Driver receives notification
6. Customer receives notification

### Scenario 2: Attempted Re-assignment (Before Fix)
❌ Owner could assign same order again → Data corruption

### Scenario 3: Attempted Re-assignment (After Fix)
✅ Assignment controls hidden
✅ "Already Assigned" badge displayed
✅ API prevents duplicate assignment

### Scenario 4: Reassignment (After Fix)
1. Owner sees "✓ Already Assigned"
2. Clicks [X] unassign button
3. Confirms action
4. Driver is unassigned
5. Assignment controls reappear
6. Owner can now assign different driver
7. Both old and new drivers notified

## Technical Details

### Frontend State Management
- `selectedDriver` state tracks dropdown selections per order
- Conditional rendering based on `order.driver_id`
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### Backend Validation
- **Assign**: Checks if `order.driver_id` already exists
- **Unassign**: Checks if `order.driver_id` is set
- Proper HTTP status codes (400 for validation errors)

### Database Updates

**On Assignment**:
```javascript
{
  driver_id: "driver-uuid",
  driver_name: "John Doe",
  delivery_status: "assigned",
  assigned_at: "2025-10-22T10:30:00Z",
  updated_at: "2025-10-22T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**On Unassignment**:
```javascript
{
  driver_id: null,
  driver_name: null,
  delivery_status: "pending",
  assigned_at: null,
  updated_at: "2025-10-22T10:35:00Z"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate assignments at API level
2. **Clear UI**: Visual indicator shows assignment status immediately
3. **Flexibility**: Owners can unassign and reassign if needed
4. **Notifications**: All parties informed of assignment changes
5. **User Experience**: Clear feedback with badges and toasts

## Testing Checklist

- [x] ✅ Backend syntax validation
- [ ] Try to assign driver to unassigned order → Should work
- [ ] Try to assign driver to already-assigned order → Should show badge
- [ ] Try API call to already-assigned order → Should return 400 error
- [ ] Click unassign button → Should clear assignment
- [ ] Assign different driver after unassignment → Should work
- [ ] Check notifications for driver and customer
- [ ] Verify database updates correctly

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Order has no driver** → Show assignment controls
2. **Order has driver** → Show badge, hide assignment controls
3. **Direct API call attempts duplicate** → Rejected with error message
4. **Unassign non-assigned order** → Error returned
5. **Driver deleted but still assigned** → Driver name preserved in order

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Show assignment history (who was assigned when)
- [ ] Allow direct driver reassignment (one-step process)
- [ ] Bulk driver assignment for multiple orders
- [ ] Auto-assign based on driver availability/location
- [ ] Driver workload balancing
- [ ] Assignment lock (prevent unassignment after pickup)
