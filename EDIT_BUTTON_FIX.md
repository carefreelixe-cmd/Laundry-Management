# 🔧 Edit Button Fix Applied

## ✅ Changes Made:

### **1. Added Edit Button**
- Added "Edit Order" button next to "Cancel Order"
- Buttons only show for orders that are:
  - NOT completed ✅
  - NOT cancelled ✅
  - Created within last 8 hours ✅

### **2. Button Layout**
```jsx
<div className="flex gap-2">
  <Button variant="outline" onClick={editOrder}>
    <Edit icon /> Edit Order
  </Button>
  <Button variant="destructive" onClick={cancelOrder}>
    Cancel Order
  </Button>
</div>
```

---

## ⚠️ Why You Don't See Buttons in Screenshot:

**Your order status is "cancelled"** - The condition checks:
```javascript
{order.status !== 'completed' && 
 order.status !== 'cancelled' &&  // ❌ Your order is cancelled!
 canModifyOrder(order.created_at) && (
  // Buttons here
)}
```

**Cancelled orders cannot be edited or cancelled again!**

---

## ✅ When You WILL See Buttons:

### **Create a NEW order** (not cancelled):

1. Order status: **pending** ✅
2. Created: **within 8 hours** ✅
3. Result: **Edit + Cancel buttons visible** ✅

**Example:**
```
ORD-000002
Status: pending  (not cancelled)
Created: just now
✅ Edit Order button
❌ Cancel Order button
```

---

## 🧪 To Test:

1. **Create a new order**
2. **DO NOT cancel it**
3. You should see:
   - ✅ "Editable" badge
   - ✅ "Edit Order" button
   - ✅ "Cancel Order" button

4. **After 8 hours**, buttons disappear and show:
   - 🔒 "Locked" badge
   - ⚠️ Warning message

## 📋 Button Visibility Logic:

| Order Status | Created Time | Edit Button | Cancel Button |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| pending | < 8 hours | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| pending | > 8 hours | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |
| completed | any | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |
| cancelled | any | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |
| processing | < 8 hours | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |

---

## 🎯 Your Specific Case:

**Current Order:**
- Order: ORD-000001
- Status: **cancelled** ❌
- Created: 10/20/2025
- Result: **No buttons shown** (correct behavior!)

**What You Need:**
- Create NEW order
- Keep status as **pending** or **processing**
- Buttons will appear! ✅

---

## Console Debugging:

Open browser console (F12) and you should see:
```
Hours since creation: 0.001, Can edit: true
```

If it says:
```
Hours since creation: 9.5, Can edit: false
```
Then the order is too old (> 8 hours).

---

**Summary:** Your cancelled order correctly shows NO buttons. Create a new pending order to see the Edit and Cancel buttons! 🎉
